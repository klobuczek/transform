Getting started.

Install the gem or run from source:
rake build
rake install

Run the transformer with:
tnf <script_name>

An example script and input file are located in the sample directory:
cd sample
tnf script

This should create the result and all intermediate files b.csv through f.csv.

A documentation of the DSL API can be found in lib/transform/dsl.rb.

The doc directory contains presentation slides about the framework.
